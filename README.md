# RMMInject

**RMMInject** (Roblox Manual Map Injector) is a robust manual-mapping injection method for Roblox, developed to bypass the AMDXX64.dll patch. It provides a seamless and efficient way to inject DLLs into Roblox. **RMMInject** is open-source and written in C++.

**UPDATE!**

With the latest hyperion update adding CFG memory protection, RMMInject isn't working. You can either wait for the new version (releasing tommorow), or quickly upgrade your base to make it work now!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

If Roblox crashes after injection, it's likely due to incorrect offsets for the following parameters:

- `SCF_INSERTED_JMP`
- `SCF_END_MARKER`
- `PAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `SCF_MARKER_STK`
- `kPageMask`
- `kPageShift`
- `kPageHash`
- `InsertSet`
- `WhitelistedPages`
  
These offsets are subject to change with updates, so always ensure you have the correct values.

### üìú **Current Offsets**

```cpp
//updated offsets for version-1e91b4133e334c9c!

namespace Offsets
{
    // No need to update these, they dont fucking change
    constexpr uint16_t SCF_INSERTED_JMP = 0x04EB;
    constexpr uint32_t SCF_END_MARKER = 0xF4CC02EB;
    constexpr uintptr_t SCF_MARKER_STK = 0xDEADBEEFDEADC0DE;
    constexpr uint64_t kPageMask = 0xfffffffffffff000;
    constexpr uint8_t kPageShift = 0xc;

    // These offsets change every update be warned!
    constexpr uint64_t kPageHash = 0x84B3A57D90E73527;
    constexpr uint64_t Offset_InsertSet = 0xC43D00;
    constexpr uint64_t Offset_WhitelistedPages = 0x29C758;
}
```

### üîß **Setup & Usage**

1. **Compile**: Build the project in your preferred IDE or use a tool like Visual Studi | **MAKE SURE BUILD CONFIG IS SET TO Release x64**
3. **Ensure Correct Offsets**: If you encounter crashes, verify that the offsets are up to date.
